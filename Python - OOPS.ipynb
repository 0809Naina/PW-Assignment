    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes and Objects are fundamental concepts:\n",
    "1. Class:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of this class will have. Essentially, a class is a way to organize data and functions that operate on that data.\n",
    "A class defines:\n",
    "Attributes (also called fields or properties): These are the data members of a class, which represent the state of an object.\n",
    "Methods (also called functions or behaviors): These are functions that define the behaviors or actions that an object of the class can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from that class. Each object has its own state (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined by the class.\n",
    "In simpler terms, think of a class as a blueprint, and an object as a specific instance of that blueprint."
